## Project Overview
The goal of this project is twofold: ship capacity prediction and ferry route optimization.

## Ship Capacity Prediction
In the machine learning part of the project, we utilized Python's extensive library ecosystem, particularly scikit-learn, to train 
regression models for predicting the number of containers a ship can carry. The models employed include Random Forest, Neural Network, 
and Support Vector Machine regressors. These models were trained on a comprehensive dataset comprising ship details such as year built, 
tonnage, dimensions, and bay numbers. The inputs were normalized using MinMaxScaler to ensure accurate predictions. By evaluating the 
models using mean squared error (MSE) and cross-validation, we gained insights into their performance and selected the most effective 
one.

## Ferry Route Optimization
The optimization part of the project focused on designing optimal ferry routes to minimize the distance traveled while ensuring that 
each route visits four stops. Python's flexibility and rich library ecosystem enabled us to implement a hill climber algorithm, which 
explores different mutation operators such as shuffling, swapping, and ruin-and-recreate. These mutation operators were used to generate
new solutions and improve the routes' fitness. The fitness function, considering both the total distance traveled and constraint 
violations, was designed to guide the optimization process.
